/// Extends [SharedEmitterImpl] to provide event resolution capabilities for WebSocket events.
/// Before emitting an event, the emitter applies a series of [EventResolver]s to inspect
/// and potentially transform the event. The first resolver that returns a non-null result
/// determines the event that will be emitted.
///
/// This is particularly useful for:
/// - Converting generic events to more specific event types
/// - Adding metadata or context to events
/// - Filtering or transforming events before emission
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final emitter = MutableEventEmitter<WsEvent>(
///   resolvers: [
///     (event) => event is GenericEvent ? SpecificEvent(event.data) : null,
///   ],
/// );
///
/// emitter.on<SpecificEvent>((event) {
///   // Handle SpecificEvent
/// });
///
/// emitter.emit(GenericEvent(data)); // Will be resolved to SpecificEvent
/// ```

  /// Creates a new [MutableEventEmitter] with optional event resolvers.
  ///
  /// When [resolvers] are provided, they will be applied to each emitted event
  /// in order until one returns a non-null result. The [replay] and [sync]
  /// parameters are passed to the underlying [SharedEmitterImpl].
