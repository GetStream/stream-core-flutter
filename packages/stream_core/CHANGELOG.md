## Upcoming

### 🛑 Breaking / Removals

- Removed the `userId` parameter from `UserToken.anonymous`, anonymous tokens always use `UserToken.anonymousUserId`
- Removed the `TokenManager.tokenProvider` setter, use `setTokenProvider` instead

### ✨ Features

- Added `TokenManager.setTokenProvider`, which points an existing manager at another user and expires the cached token
- Added optional `onTokenUpdated` callback to `TokenManager`, invoked after every successful token load
- Added optional `rawValue` to `UserToken.anonymous`, so an anonymous token can carry a JWT granting restricted access, provided its `user_id` claim is `UserToken.anonymousUserId`
- Added `UserToken.anonymousUserId`, the user id used for anonymous authentication
- Added `teams` field to `User` class

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed `TokenManager.getToken()` contacting the `TokenProvider` on every call instead of returning the cached token
- Fixed `DynamicTokenProvider` accepting a token issued for a different user than the one requested
- Fixed `TokenManager` caching a token that finished loading after `expireToken` or `setTokenProvider` had invalidated it
