## Upcoming

### 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

- Removed the `userId` parameter from `UserToken.anonymous`, anonymous tokens always use `User.anonymousUserId`
- Removed the `TokenManager.tokenProvider` setter, use `setTokenProvider` instead
- `TokenManager.userId` is now nullable, and is `null` until an identity is configured
- `User` now requires a user of type `UserType.anonymous` to carry `User.anonymousUserId` as its id. A mismatch fails to compile in a const context, and throws in debug mode otherwise

### ✨ Features

- Added `TokenManager.setTokenProvider`, which points an existing manager at another user and expires the cached token; handed the identity it already has, it does nothing
- Added optional `onTokenUpdated` callback to `TokenManager`, invoked after every successful token load
- Added optional `rawValue` to `UserToken.anonymous`, so an anonymous token can carry a JWT granting restricted access; its `user_id` claim must be `!anon`
- Added `UserToken.expiresAt`, from the token's `exp` claim, and `UserToken.isExpired`, which takes an optional `leeway`
- Added `User.anonymousUserId`, the id every anonymous user has
- Added `TokenManager.unconfigured`, for a client that exists before its user does, and `TokenManager.reset`, which drops the configured identity and its cached token
- Added `teams` field to `User` class

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed three faults in `TokenManager`'s token cache: `getToken` contacted the provider on every call instead of returning the cached token, handed out a token that had already expired rather than replacing it, and cached one that finished loading after `expireToken` or `setTokenProvider` had invalidated it. A static provider is left alone, having nothing fresher to give
- Fixed `DynamicTokenProvider` accepting a token issued for a different user than the one requested

### 🔄 Changed

- Raised the minimum Dart SDK to `^3.12.0`
- Anonymous requests now always send `user_id=!anon`, rather than whatever id the `TokenManager` was configured with
- `DynamicTokenProvider` checks the token type before its user id, so a token of the wrong type is reported as such instead of as a mismatched user
- `TokenManager.getToken` fails when `reset` runs while the token is loading, and rejects a token whose `user_id` is not the user it was loading for; a `setTokenProvider` during a load still serves the caller that started it
- `AuthInterceptor` no longer attempts a token refresh when the manager has no identity, so the original token-expired error is surfaced rather than a failure to load a token
- `SystemEnvironmentManager.updateEnvironment` now sanitizes the passed `SystemEnvironment`, so an integrator can enrich the Stream client header without changing the SDK identity it reports

## 0.4.0

  and `BoundingBox`
- Added `insertAt` parameter to `upsert` for controlling insertion position of new elements

## 0.3.1

### ✨ Features

- Added `updateWhere` method for updating elements matching a filter condition
- Added `batchReplace` method for replacing multiple elements based on matching keys
- Added `insertUnique` method for inserting elements ensuring uniqueness by key with optional sorting
- Added `update` parameter to `upsert` for custom merge logic when replacing existing elements
- Added `update` parameter to `batchReplace` for custom merge logic

### ✨ Features

- Added `matches(T other)` method for client-side filtering with PostgreSQL-like semantics
- Added utility functions for deep equality, subset containment, and type-safe comparisons
